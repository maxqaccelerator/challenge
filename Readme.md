## Hack Rules
- Teams can be anywhere from one to four members. Remember, hacking with others is more fun!
- All teams retain full ownership of what they have created during the Hackathon.
- All attendees who [apply for the Skywatch API] will be granted access. Use of other open data and open-source libraries is also encouraged.
- There will be no alcohol served or allowed on site.
- Just like Star Trek, we celebrate our differences. Infinite Diversity in Infinite Combinations. So harassment and racist, sexist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate for this event.
- Consideration is golden. Please be mindful of others in the space. Our hosts at [MakeWorks] may still be at their private coworking desks on the other side of the room.
