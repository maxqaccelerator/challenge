## Open Space Data
You’re living on a changing planet, monitored by orbiting spectrometers. You’ve been granted early access to an index of datasets from 5 emissions satellites; AIRS (NASA JPL), GOSAT (JAXA), MOPITT (NASA EOS), OCO-2 (NASA JPL), and TES (NASA JPL). Locate specific sources of greenhouse gases, identify changes over time, or create impactful visualizations.

## Physical Prototyping
You're sending astronauts aboard an orbiting spacecraft. In closed life support systems, control of pathogenic microorganisms is critical. You've been granted access to a cnc laser cutter so you can rapidly cut components from sheet material with high precision. Design a biofilter that can be packed flat and assembled in orbit, research and propose a culture to treat graywater and gas loaded with ammonia and hydrogen sulfide, or build a purification system to remove enough suspended particles that ultraviolet germicidal irradiation of the output is effective.

## Ingenious Creations:
You're the boss. Invent an ingenious space-related concept and wow the room with your ability to both identify real-world problems and solve them.
